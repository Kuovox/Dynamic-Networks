## üß† Overview

This project implements a **Graph Analysis Tool** designed to explore and visualize social and large-scale networks using Python. The program loads graphs from `.gml` files, computes key metrics such as clustering coefficients and neighborhood overlap, partitions the network into communities, tests for homophily and balance, and simulates temporal and structural changes.

This project demonstrates the analysis of dynamic network behaviors through clustering, robustness testing, and temporal simulation.

## üìä Approach Summary

### Clustering Coefficient

Computed with `nx.clustering(G)`, measuring how interconnected each node‚Äôs neighbors are.

### Neighborhood Overlap

Calculated per edge using shared neighbor ratio. Stored as `overlap` edge attribute.

### Community Detection

Girvan‚ÄìNewman algorithm used to partition graph into modular communities.

### Homophily Verification

A **t-test** compares clustering coefficients between attribute-based node groups.

### Structural Balance

BFS traversal checks for signed triads where sign product < 0 (unbalanced triads).

### Failure Simulation & Robustness

Randomly remove *k* edges and measure the resulting structure. `--robustness_check` averages across multiple trials.

### Temporal Simulation

Processes edge events over timestamps, logging additions/removals step-by-step.
