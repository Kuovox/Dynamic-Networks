## üß† Overview

This project implements a **Traffic Equilibrium Analysis Tool** using Python. The program computes and visualizes the **Travel Equilibrium (Nash Equilibrium)** and **Social Optimality** in a directed traffic network.  

Given a directed graph where each edge is defined by a **cost function** of the form:

\[
c(x) = a x + b
\]

the program determines how vehicles distribute themselves along the available paths between an initial and final node to achieve both **individual equilibrium** and **system-wide efficiency**.

The program reads `.gml` files describing the graph structure and edge parameters, performs equilibrium calculations, and optionally generates visualizations of the network and its edge cost functions.
